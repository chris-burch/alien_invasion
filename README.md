# alien_invasion

This is the the space invader game project, in which my project is based on.

Some things you'll need before you run the code

1. a Python compiler
2. Pygame - you can usually download this easily with cmd prompt/terminal
3. Download all the files and put them into one folder on your computer. 
You'll need to make a "images" folder within that folder you made to store the images from this project

That should be everything you need to run the code. if you have any problems, please email me at chrisbrch@gmail.com.

Thanks!
